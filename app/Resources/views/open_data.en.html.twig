                <h2>Open data</h2>

                <p>Museums provide their users access to a wealth of cultural heritage objects either by exhibiting them, or by presenting them via digital channels. Many of these cultural objects, their digital copies and parts of the accrued metadata are subject to concerns such as copyright and intellectual property rights, confidentiality, security and privacy. To protect the concerns related to cultural heritage objects, museums will implement a balanced policy governing access to these cultural resources.</p>

                <p>The Flemish Art Collection complements these policies with a series of open access and open data initiatives to enhance digital access to knowledge about the cultural heritage collections preserved by the museums.</p>

                <p>The Flemish Art Collection leverages the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licensing framework to govern access to metadata published via the Dashboard.</p>

                <h3>Layered licensing model</h3>

                <p>To disseminate metadata under the terms established by the Creative Commons licensing framework, the Flemish Art Collection closely cooperates with its museal partners. The guiding principles which govern the process of clearing data and metadata for publication under these terms, are consolidated in a decision making matrix: a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3x7oajc5yg8wl8/layered%20licence%20matrix%20flemish%20art%20collection160913.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Layered Licensing Model</a>.</p>
