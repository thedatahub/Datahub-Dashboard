# Datahub Dashboard

[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE)

The Datahub Dashboard is an application which allows users and data providers to measure the completeness, unambiguity, richness and openness of their metadata. The metadata is retrieved from an OAI-PMH endpoint, for example a [Datahub](https://github.com/thedatahub/Datahub) application.

## Requirements

This project requires following dependencies:
* PHP >= 5.5.9
  * With the php-cli and php-xml extensions.
  * The [PECL Mongo](https://pecl.php.net/package/mongo) (PHP5) or [PECL Mongodb](https://pecl.php.net/package/mongodb) (PHP7) extension. Note that the _mongodb_ extension must be version 1.2.0 or higher. Notably, the package included in Ubuntu 16.04 (_php-mongodb_) is only at 1.1.5.
* MongoDB >= 3.2.10

## Install

Via Git:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/thedatahub/Datahub-Dashboard
$ cd Datahub-Dashboard
$ composer install # Composer will ask you to fill in any missing parameters before it continues
```

You will be asked to configure the connection to your MongoDB database. You 
will need to provide these details (but can currently be skipped due to still being in development):

* The connection to your MongoDB instance (i.e. mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017)
* The username of the user (i.e. datahub_dashboard)
* The password of the user
* The database where your data will persist (i.e. datahub_dashboard)

Before you install, ensure that you have a running MongoDB instance. A mongodb user is not required at this point.

If you want to run the dashboard for testing or development purposes, execute this command:

``` bash
$ app/console server:run
```

Use a browser and Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000). 
You should now see the dashboard homepage.

Refer to the [Symfony setup documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html) 
to complete your installation using a fully featured web server to make your 
installation operational in a production environment.

## Usage

### Initial setup

In order to fill up the dashboard database with the necessary metadata, run this command:
```bash
$ php bin/console app:fetch-data
```

The command takes an optional parameter, namely the URL of the OAI-PMH endpoint. This URL can also be configured in config/parameters.yml.
In order to update the data on a regular basis, consider putting the command in a cron job.

## Front end development

Front end workflows are managed via [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and 
[webpack-encore](https://symfony.com/blog/introducing-webpack-encore-for-asset-management.

The layout is based on [Bootstrap 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) 
and managed via sass. The code can be found under `app/resources/public/sass`. 

Javascript files can be found under `assets/js`. Dependencies are 
managed via `yarn`. Add vendor modules using `require`.

Files are build and stored in `web/build` and included in `app/Resources/views/base.html.twig`
via the `asset()` function.

The workflow configuration can be found in `webpack.config.js`.

Get started:

```
# Install all dependencies
$ yarn install

# Build everything in development
$ yarn run encore dev

# Watch files and build automatically
$ yarn run encore dev --watch

# Build for production
$ yarn run encore production
```
